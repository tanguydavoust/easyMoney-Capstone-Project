 ## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Science Master's final project, completed as part of my studies at Nuclio School. In this project, I aim to showcase my understanding of the concepts learned during the program and apply them to a real-world scenario. The project involves an in-depth analysis of the fintech company "easyMoney," providing insights and recommendations to address its current challenges.

## Context

Founded bnearly four years ago, easyMoney offers user-friendly financial products, including savings and investments.

Despite early successes, easyMoney now faces challenges such as over-diversifying its product offerings, lack of profitability, and addressing internal issues. The project aims to apply data science techniques to provide actionable insights. By analyzing historical data and developing predictive models, we aim to support easyMoney's growth and address real-world business challenges.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Analyze the historical performance and current challenges of easyMoney.
2. Identify key factors affecting the company's profitability and growth.
3. Develop data-driven insights and recommendations for easyMoney's future strategy.
4. Create predictive models to assess customer behavior and optimize marketing efforts.
5. Provide actionable insights to address internal issues and streamline operations.
